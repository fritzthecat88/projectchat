# Serbian Child Allowance Eligibility Chatbot

## Project Overview
This is a Streamlit-based chatbot that helps Serbian citizens determine their eligibility for child allowance (deƒçiji dodatak) based on Serbian law "Zakon o finansijskoj podr≈°ci –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü–∏ sa decom".

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic chatbot working with LangChain and OpenAI
- ‚úÖ Simple eligibility checking (age, income, number of children)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only checks 3 basic conditions, but law has many more requirements
- üîÑ Need to implement comprehensive eligibility checking

## Technical Stack
